Given a set of training features X and labels Y, come up with a set of weights that most accurately predict a new y given a new x.

The weights are a set of coefficients and the x values are all to the first power, thus the entire function is linear.

Standard loss function is the squared distance between the predicted y and actual y. The derivative of the loss function
has a global minimum that can be calculated to find the optimal set of weights.

Use linear regression when your data is roughly linear and when your inputs and outputs are continuous. Beware outliers. 

Allows you to see how each factor the output.
